Developed a machine learning-based intrusion detection system using a
dataset of TCP/IP connections in a simulated military network environment. Engineered 41 quantitative and qualitative
features to classify network connections as ”Normal” or ”Anomalous.” Trained and evaluated multiple models, including
ensemble and deep learning approaches, optimizing for high accuracy in anomaly detection. Employed data preprocessing
techniques such as feature scaling, encoding, and temporal feature engineering.
